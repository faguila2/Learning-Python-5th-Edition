I have had no problem committing and pushing my changes to my GitHub repo. But today, I tried doing it and I get a message like this You don’t have permissions to push to “Name/Name of Project” on GitHub. Would you like to create a fork and push to it instead?

How can I fix this?

Thanks for your help! I figured it out by asking chatGPT lol. I’ll leave this here for anyone else that runs into this problem:

The error message you’re seeing indicates an issue with your SSH key configuration. To fix this and successfully push your changes, you can follow these steps:

Generate a new SSH key: Open your terminal and run the following command to generate a new SSH key:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
Replace “your_email@example.com” with the email address associated with your GitHub account. Press Enter to accept the default file location and leave the passphrase empty if you don’t want to set one.

Add the SSH key to your SSH agent: Start the SSH agent in the background and add your private SSH key to it using the following commands:

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
If you used a different file name or location for your SSH key in step 1, adjust the file path accordingly.

Add the SSH key to your GitHub account: Copy the contents of your public SSH key using the following command:

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
If the command above doesn’t work, you can open the SSH key file in a text editor and manually copy the contents. Then, go to the “Settings” of your GitHub account, navigate to “SSH and GPG keys,” click on “New SSH key,” and paste the copied key into the field.

Test the SSH connection: To verify that your SSH key is correctly set up, run the following command:

ssh -T git@github.com
You should see a message confirming that you’ve successfully authenticated.

Once you’ve completed these steps, try pushing your changes to the repository again using the git push command. The SSH key should now be properly configured, allowing you to authenticate and push your commits to GitHub.

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "javier.aguilar@infineon.com"

eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

ssh -T git@github.com
